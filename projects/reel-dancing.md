The Society is proud to support The Scots Reel Dancers, a Chicago-based group of folk dancers reconstructing the social dances of early Scotland.

Dances are open to all, regardless of who they are or their prior experience, and meet at [The Lab on Lake](https://lab3450.squarespace.com/) (3450 W. Lake St). An optional class on footwork starts at 7pm, a brief introduction for first-time dancers takes place around 7:30, and then the dancing begins in earnest and runs until 9:40pm. A mixture of Scots reels and contras will be called by Meg Dedolph, with live music by [Tim Macdonald & Jeremy Ward](http://timandjeremy.com/).

Upcoming dates:

* April 25

* May 2

* May 9

* May 16

Admission is $5 for students and seniors and a sliding scale from $10-30 for others.
