The **Chicago Scottish Fiddle Camp** is a weekend workshop for beginning to
intermediate fiddlers. It includes group music classes, Scottish dancing, and an end-of-camp performance for the residents of Caledonia Senior Living.

Students should have moderate experience playing any style of music on the violin
(or another acoustic instrument—it's open to all musicians) and should have
interest in (but not necessarily experience with) Scottish music.

Details for the 2019 session will be announced shortly—enter your email below to be notified when registration details are announced:
